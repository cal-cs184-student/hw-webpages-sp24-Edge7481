<h2 align="middle">Overview</h2>
<p>Give a high-level overview of what you implemented in this project. Think about what you've built as a whole. Share your thoughts on what interesting things you've learned from completing the project.</p>

<p>
  In this project I implemented the simulation of cloth materials by using a spring mesh. I implemented how the cloth would behave by
  using verlet integration to compute the force at each point of the cloth, as well as implement collision detection to ensure that it doesn't
  cross through objects or itself. For the last part, i implemented various shaders to simulate color, texture, and reflection of the materials.
</p>


<h2 align="middle">Part I: Masses and springs</h2>

<p>In this part I implemented the point-mass mesh representation of cloth. This simulates the behavior of cloth by calculating the behavior
  of each spring between points based on external force. The 3 types of springs are structural, which maintain distance
  between adjacent vertices, shearing, which control how parallel vertices slide against each other, and bending, which control
  vertices farther away from adjacent vertices.
</p>

  </div>

  <h2 align="middle">Part 2: Simulation via numerical integration</h2>
  <p>
    In this part I implemented the simulation of cloth using verlet integration. This part of the project computes all of the forces
    acting on each spring and how the forces on the springs affect each other. In the end, these forces are converted into
    accelerations and velocities in order to simulate the position of each point mass in the next time step. Note that I also implemented
    Provot's contraints to prevent springs from being unreasonably deformed.
  </p>

  <div align="middle">
    <table style="width:100%">
      <tr align="center">
        <td>
          <img src="2.1.png" align="middle" width="400px"/>
          <figcaption>ks = 5000</figcaption>
        </td>
        <td>
          <img src="2.2.png" align="middle" width="400px"/>
          <figcaption>ks = 30000</figcaption>
        </td>
        </tr>
    </table>
  </div>

  <p>
    ks affects how rigid the material is. since spring displacement is inversely proportional to the string constant, we can see that
    increasing ks from 5000 to 30000 makes it much more difficult for force (gravity) to extend the springs.
  </p>

  <div align="middle">
    <table style="width:100%">
      <tr align="center">
        <td>
          <img src="2.3.png" align="middle" width="400px"/>
          <figcaption>density = 3</figcaption>
        </td>
        <td>
          <img src="2.4.png" align="middle" width="400px"/>
          <figcaption>density = 30</figcaption>
        </td>
        </tr>
    </table>
  </div>

  <p>
    Increasing the density is essentially increasing the mass, which in turn increases the spring extension. Since force is directly proportional with mass, a higher density means 
    a stronger pull from gravity.
  </p>

  <div align="middle">
    <table style="width:100%">
      <tr align="center">
        <td>
          <img src="2.5.png" align="middle" width="400px"/>
          <figcaption>damping = ~5%</figcaption>

          <figcaption>damping = ~80%</figcaption>
        </td>
        </tr>
    </table>
  </div>

  <p>
    damping attempts to simulate how energy is lost. The higher the damping, the more energy lost per time step. Note the
    ripples at the bottom of the cloth with in the image with low damping. The material oscillates for significantly longer due there still being
    energy in the cloth. On the other hand, the simulation with high damping sees the material converge to a resting state.

  <h2 align="middle">Part 3: Handling collisions with other objects</h2>

  <p>
    In this part I implemented computing the collision of the cloth with spheres and planes. For the sphere case, I check whether
    the distance between the point mass's position and the sphere's origin. If the point mass is closer to the sphere than the radius,
    I update the position to be the minimal position outside the sphere (tangent), adjusted by friction to simulate the cloth sliding over the sphere.

    For the plane case, I use dot products to determine if the point mass has passed through the plane between 2 time steps. If that is the case,
    I calculate the direction from the point mass's last position to the current position, and move it towards the previous position when it
    tangents with the plane. Friction is adjusted in the same way as the sphere case.
  </p>

  <div align="middle">
    <table style="width:100%">
      <tr align="center">
        <td>
          <img src="3.1.png" align="middle" width="400px"/>
          <figcaption>ks=5000</figcaption>
        </td>
        <td>
          <img src="3.2.png" align="middle" width="400px"/>
          <figcaption>ks=500</figcaption>
        </td>
        </tr>
        <tr align="center">
          <td>
            <img src="3.3.png" align="middle" width="400px"/>
            <figcaption>ks=50000</figcaption>
          </td>
          </tr>
    </table>
  </div>
  <p>
    Again, ks affects the material by making it more rigid as ks increases. A higher ks means that it takes more force to stretch
    the springs to the same degree, so the material looks very much more deformed in ks=500 compared to ks=50000

  <h2 align="middle">Part 4: Handling self-collisions</h2>

  <p>
    In this part I implemented self-collisions by first building a spatial hash of the point masses to constrain calculations to only points
    that are close enough to collide. After that, I continuously check each point against the possible collision candidates in the table and
    flag it as collided if they're within a certain thickness apart. If a collision is detected, I apply opposite forces of the point with
    the points it collided with. By averaging the force from each other collision point, it essentially moves the point away from all of the collided
    points.

          </tr>
    </table>

    <p>
      the same observations as parts 2 and 3. Increasing ks makes the cloth more rigid, whereas increasing density does the opposite.
      This ties back to the amount of force needed to deform a spring. Density increases the mass from F=ma, ks increases the spring coefficient
      from hooke's law F=kx
    </p>

    <h2 align="middle">Part 5: Shaders</h2>
    <p alight>
      Our shaders have two main components. These are executed in the GPU, which is specialized to handle geometric calculations:
      <br>
      The vertex shader converts vertices described in 3d space and convert it to 2d representations in the screen space.
      The vertex shader also sets up the normals to be used in fragment shaders.
      <br>
      The fragment shader come after the vertex shaders in the pipeline. It uses the information from vertex shaders along with
      additional information to determine the color of each pixel. potentially on the screen. Most of the visual appearnce stuff is done here.
      This include calculating light reflections for shading, texture/bump/displacement mapping for a textured appearance, etc. 
      As an example, my implementation of phong.frag basically takes the light equation word for word to generate phong shading.

  <p alight>
    Blinn-Phong shading is a composite of 3 parts that we can loosely assign lighting in real life into. The ambient component is a
    rough estimation (without tracing every ray many times) of light that is bouncing everywhere in the scene, and applies a constant
    amount of illumination to every direction of the susrface. This also prevents parts of the scene being completely dark,
    since this is rarely the case in real life. The diffuse component represents reflections on rough surfaces that scatter in many directions. This
    is a simplification of textured objects in real life with tiny peaks and troughs that reflect light in different directions. Surfaces
    perpendicular to the incoming light scatter more light. The third component is specular, and it simulates the shiny spots on objects
    by approximating it as a mirror. Light is reflected into one direction. All 3 components are weighted and added together to give the
    object a realistic look.

<p>
  The finer the mesh, the more accurate the sphere is transformed
  by the texture. It is difficult to see, but by zooming in we can see that the 128 version has
  much more jagged edges (that match the texture) than the 16 version. This in turn makes the image more realistic, as displacement mapping
  alters the geometry of the sphere, making it fit better with the texture.
